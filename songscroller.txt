Chromag_-_Charming_but_Drunk.xm
	rebels versohlt aersche mit einem gigantischen chiptune!!! this is chromag/rebels writing some lines. after more than a decade i was kindly allowed to join rebels again and provide you with some new tunes. i hope you like this little follow-up to the famous -charming but drunk- series which had started with the release of chromagic in 1993. it was actually made with titans great milkytracker, the only tracker with the ft2 feel on it! thanks also to my parents for buying me an amiga500 in 1987, as well as to karsten obarski who made me stop using the crappy aegis sonix and switch over to the real thing, the soundtracker. expect some more tunes in the near future, hopefully to be released in more fine rebels productions. some short greetings to exciter, virgill, lincoln, sargor, boo, steeler, everyone in fairlight, everyone in haujobb, everyone in talent, polka brothers, rebels and especially to everyone at totalkaos.
Dalezy_-_Agent_X.xm
	probably the worst cover of a follin tune ever. just pretend that you never heard it and we're all safe.
Dalezy_-_Kroeme.xm
	dedicated to crome. done after evoke2005 while having the flu.
Dalezy_-_Trollvisan.xm
	a tune i did for the trolls in my head. they didn't like it.
Ne7_-_End_of_the_Beginning.it
	hi ppl, vincenzo on the keys. i'm trying to write something about ne7's tunes, but i don't think that ne7'll do the same with my musics :) so, in this tune ne7 uses some c64 waves, generated with goat tracker. it's a nice melodic tune with a nice lead sound. my personal favourite from ne7.
Ne7_-_I_Miss_Those_Days.it
	ne7 misses those days... just like all of us: we remember often for the good o'days, pardeys, friends, etc. do youe remember..??...
Ne7_-_It's_Raineing.it
	nice shuffle-tempo flowing. i like shuffle-tempo, i like the rain. i like the lead in this music but sadly, it's short a lil'bit. so listen it after the loop starts :)
Ne7_-_Last_Marlboro,_Last_Day.it
	i don't smoke. ne7 is smokin'. maybe he's composing his tunes between two smoke. that's good - every musician needs something when composing music...
Ne7_-_So_There.it
	this music from ne7 reminds me of some old c64 game tune. hard rythm and a lot of arpeggios. i don't think that this is a happy tune, but it should be good for an ingame-music in a shoot'em'up game.
Ne7_-_Summer_Breeze.it
	nice to hear the music of ne7. he uses the leads great, and this tune makes me happy with it's great melodic flow. ps: did you recognized the birds in this music? :)
Ne7_-_Summer_Sun.it
	i think ne7 likes the sun, likes the summer. maybe he composed this tune in a nice, shiny afternoon. happy, easy melody makes this tune to another favourite tune of mine. i need to listen this again :)

PaleDeth_-_In_A_Heartbeat.xm
Pikzel_&_Algar_-_Mattias_Sausage_Hunt.xm
	this is a quick but happy song from the dynamic duo pikzel & algar! we started this song a while ago, and i, pikzel that is, instantly had the feeling that this was a sausage song. and not just any sausage song, it was the song of the sausage hunt, dedicated to mattias for going on and on about sausages all the time :) KORV!
Raina_-_Yellowhale.xm
Rebb_-_Devious.mod
	Originally .mod for PSP release, but was never used. Quite fast made tune as always. Release more OCS stuff, compose more mod's and world will be better place. Fuckings to lamers!
Rebb_-_Nessuno_Cracktro.mod
	.mod for unreleased Nessuno cracktro. Big thanks to Premium/Paradise & Tempest/Fairlight for their comments and critism about the tune. Dedicated to Laura <3 and my almost dead A1200 which I still use for composing. Short greets to Brainstorm,Accession,Damones and my groupmates in Paradise.

Svenzzon_-_Blizzard.xm
	This was made for a blizzard keygen and for Milkytrackers newest release. Keep chipping !
Svenzzon_-_The_Titan_Turrican.xm
	This was the first tune for Titans Milkytracker release, one of the best turrican melodies ever. Tracked in 2 days using Milkytracker <3
Vincenzo_-_F457.it
	heyo ppl, vincenzo types his 3rd scrolltext ever \o/ yes, i count them because it's very important to know :) i contributed to this musicdisk with 4 music, f457, tuesday 44, strawbrry jam and pyros. and if everything is all right you're currently listenin' "f457". strange title, strange tune. replace the letters: 4=a, 5=s, 7=t and read the result :) anyway, the lead is another strange thingie, i tried a "new" technique to compose the melody: typed all the notes which fit the tune and placed random volume settings to it. yeah, it is not copyrighted yet :)
Vincenzo_-_Pyros.it
	no more scroller-countin'... boring... just listen to my next tune in this co-op musicdisk. the title "pyros" means "red" in hungarian (if you change the y to i). the tune is loopin' after 1:19 and it changes from normal to shuffle tempo in every 2 pattern.
Vincenzo_-_Strawberry_Jam.it
	let's change from normal beats to breakbeats! - thinks vincenzo... a simple doubled-rhythm saves this tune to become boring. when i started to compose this i was in a bad mood because the bad weather (rainin' and rainin' more). and when i finished the song the sun looked at me, birds tweeted - my moral changed. "always look at the bright side of life"
Vincenzo_-_Tuesday_44.it
	yo, here comes vincenzo's 4th scrolltext ever \o/ i hope i won't miscountin' my scrolltexts in the future :) my another tune in this nice chipdisk is "tuesday 44". and why 44? because i remeber that i composed this in tuesday but don't know which tuesday... i'm in trouble when i finish a song and i need to add a title to it... and now an important message to mattias -> REBELS! :)
